      Insurance in decentralized finance (DeFi) works in much the same way as
      traditional insurance, with a few key differences. In traditional
      insurance, a policyholder pays premiums to an insurance company, which
      provides financial protection in the event of a loss or other covered
      event. In DeFi, insurance is typically provided by a smart contract on a
      blockchain, rather than by a traditional insurance company.

      Here are some key points to consider when thinking about insurance in
      DeFi:

      * Risk pooling: DeFi insurance typically works by pooling the premiums
      paid by policyholders into a shared fund. This fund is used to pay out
      claims in the event of a loss or covered event.

      * Smart contracts: DeFi insurance is typically provided through smart
      contracts on a blockchain. These smart contracts automate the process of
      calculating premiums, paying out claims, and managing the risk pool.

      * Transparency: Because DeFi insurance is provided through smart contracts
      on a blockchain, the terms of the insurance policy and the status of the
      risk pool are typically transparent and verifiable. This can give
      policyholders more confidence in the fairness and reliability of the
      insurance process.

      * Customization: DeFi insurance can be customized to meet the specific
      needs of policyholders. For example, a policyholder might be able to
      choose the specific risks they want to be covered for, or select a premium
      payment schedule that meets their needs.

      * Overall, DeFi insurance is a promising new application of blockchain
      technology that has the potential to make insurance more transparent,
      efficient, and accessible.

      Sherlock is an audit marketplace and smart contract coverage protocol
      built on the Ethereum blockchain. Sherlock works to protect Decentralized
      Finance (DeFi) users from smart contract exploits with security reviews
      from top auditors backed by smart contract coverage on the audited
      contracts.
