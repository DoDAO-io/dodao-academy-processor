    ### What is RCA 

    The present approach for offering protection to users against various risks
    is similar to that of traditional financial institutions: underwriters
    provide funding, evaluate risk, establish a cost for coverage, and users buy
    a policy.  This strategy has been effective so far but also has several
    drawbacks:  * the extent of coverage that can be offered is limited by the
    underwriters' available capital * leverage is necessary for the underwriters
    to be compensated adequately, which raises the possibility of bankruptcy *
    determining the premium prices is challenging given the limited data and
    fast-paced nature of the industry.

     Reciprocal insurance, on the other hand, does not charge premiums, and payments are only made when a loss occurs in
    one of the vaults of the ecosystem. At that point, a small percentage of
    every vault is liquidated to compensate the affected vault.
     This system operates like a reciprocal inter-insurance exchange, in which users/subscribers essentially cover each
    other against risk. However, all policies are transparent, with no premiums
    being paid in advance, and there is no reserve capital. This eliminates the
    complications associated with traditional coverage, such as risk-based
    pricing, premiums, underwriting, supply issues, solvency and more.
     This approach ensures that users pay only what is necessary, without any additional costs, no profit for
    underwriters and no concern of insolvency.

- title: How Ease works
  shortTitle: Ease protocol
  key: ease-working
  details: >
    ### How Ease works

    The Ease protocol is a decentralized insurance platform that utilizes
    smart-contracts, known as vaults, to store and insure assets.  One of the
    key features of the Ease protocol is that assets are covered reciprocally,
    which means that there are no initial expenses  for coverage and no premiums
    required. Instead, remuneration is only disbursed in the event of a
    claimable occurrence, and a minimal  sum is drawn from each vault to repay
    the loss, which can be denominated in either Ether or a stablecoin.

    The vaults in the Ease protocol act as a smart-contract that stores user's
    assets and mints ez-tokens as a proof of deposition.  These vaults also
    participate in the coverage of other vaults in the event of a claimable
    occurrence. The loss incurred by  each vault is computed by taking the same
    percentage of funds from the vault's value as the total funds lost from the
    overall  value of all vaults. This is represented mathematically as Li = Vi
    * TL / TV L.

    The RCA (reciprocally covered assets) model used by the Ease protocol
    distributes the loss across all vaults. If there is a  loss in one vault, it
    is covered by the other vaults in the system. This makes the Ease protocol a
    more efficient and  cost-effective way to insure assets when compared to
    traditional insurance methods that require underwriters to cover the assets.

    When a hack occurs, the admin of the Ease protocol will freeze the reserve
    amount in each vault according to their maximum fee.  This amount won't be
    available for withdrawal. The admin will then set the amount to be
    liquidated from the reserve amount, which  will be unique to each vault and
    based on the safety ranking and total loss from the hack. The DAO
    (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)  votes and confirms the liquidation
    of assets for each vault. 

    For example, if we have 10 vaults with equal values rated from riskiest to
    safest, a hack occurs that affects 0.1% of the ecosystem, and the maximum
    percent that can be liquidated from each before moving onto the next is
    0.5%, we will liquidate the maximum from the 2 riskiest vaults before the
    loss is fully compensated. If the hack affected more than 0.5% of the
    ecosystem, the liquidations would simply loop back around to the riskiest
    protocol and continue, so a hack affecting 0.75% of the ecosystem would end
    up liquidating 1% from each of the riskiest 5 protocols and 0.5% from each
    of the safest 5 protocols.

    ### The Conditions or guidelines for Coverage of assets

    * In the event of a deliberate manipulation of the Oracle system that causes
    panic or unauthorized withdrawal of assets, resulting in a crash, assets are
    covered.

    * In instances where there is a discrepancy from intended data sources that
    leads to Oracle failure, assets are covered.

    * If the code is used in a malicious or unintended manner, resulting in the
    withdrawal of assets from the protocol stack, assets are covered.

    * If there is an economic design failure that results in the unintentional
    confiscation or seizure of underlying assets deposited into the  top
    protocol or stack directly by the RCA vault, assets are covered.

    * In the case of a deliberate governance attack, the decisions in the Ease
    protocols are made by the DAO and there is a possibility of attack  by the
    governance, assets are covered.

    * In the event of a privileged authority acting in bad faith (such as a rug
    pull) resulting in unnecessary or unintended withdrawal of assets,  assets
    are covered.

    * If there is negligence or a lack of proper security measures by someone
    with privileged authority within the framework of a protocol that results in
    the  withdrawal of assets without the proper owner's knowledge or permission
    (e.g. a phishing attempt compromising an administrator's credentials,
    resulting in  loss of assets from the protocol directly), assets are
    covered. 

    It is important to note that these guidelines and the decisions made based
    on them will be determined by the DAO.


    ### Claim Assessment

    In the event of a security breach or hack, also known as a "covered event,"
    protocol will be implemented to safeguard all assets stored in the vaults.
    The claims process will be initiated immediately upon the occurrence of a
    covered event, during which all assets will be frozen to prevent
    unauthorized liquidation. The liquidation of these frozen assets will be
    conducted in order to compensate for any losses sustained. Claim payouts
    will be distributed in the form of Ether or other fiat-denominated
    stablecoins to the affected vaults. Following the claims process, users will
    regain access to their assets and will be able to withdraw them.

    The claims process in this system is designed to be simple and efficient, as
    the losses incurred are directly tied to the vaults rather than individual
    users. As a result, there is no need for claimants to provide proof of loss
    in order to receive coverage. Losses can be immediately verified by
    evaluating the impacted vaults, allowing for swift compensation. The
    Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will vote on the appropriate
    amount to be paid to each affected vault, and once the funds have been
    allocated, the frozen assets will be unfrozen and made available for
    withdrawal.

    The value of a vault after a hack covered event or after a hack is given
    below

    New value of vault = N

    Old value of vault = O

    New total value locked in RCA = C<sub>N</sub>

    Old total value locked in RCA = C<sub>O</sub>

    then,

    N = O*C<sub>N</sub>/  C<sub>O</sub>

    ### $EASE

    The $EASE token is a tradeable Ethereum-based (ERC-20) token with a finite
    supply. It offers various levels of utility in the Ease DeFi Uninsurance
    system. The Ease tokens can be used for bribing. It can be staked to get the
    $gvEASE tokens.

    Since Ease is the upgraded version or next version of ArmourFi, the supply
    of $EASE and $Armor stays the same. The Armour tokens can be swapped for
    ease in 1:1 ratio.


    #### History of $EASE token

    1 billion Ease tokens were initially minted, but 250 million were sent to a
    burn address. The remaining 750 million $EASE is the maximum supply, but 250
    million $EASE can be minted through a contract. This can only happen after a
    DAO vote, and even the team cannot mint extra tokens. The Ease DAO will
    control the majority of the tokens, i.e. 400 million.


    ### $gvEASE

    The $gvEase tokens are minted by staking the $Ease tokens. These are growing
    vote tokens which will grow in time.

    The $gvEASE token is a unique digital asset that offers a number of
    properties for users to take advantage of. Firstly, it is not tradable,
    meaning it cannot be bought or sold on any market. However, the staked Ease
    tokens can be withdrawn at any time, giving users the flexibility to move
    their funds as they see fit. However, it is important to note that if the
    $EASE is withdrawn, the user will receive the $EASE tokens but any
    additional $gvEASE will be lost.

    Another unique property of the $gvEASE is that it can be stacked in vaults.
    By doing so, the maximum fee is lowered for the vaults, which is the maximum
    possible fee that can be deducted in case of hack events. Additionally,
    users can also lease their $gvEASE tokens and earn weekly $EASE rewards.
    This is a popular option among vaults that have very low maximum fees, as
    they can earn rewards while still having their $gvEASE available to them for
    use in DAO voting.

    It's important to note that $gvEASE tokens can only be used for staking, not
    for DAO voting. This is because the ownership of the token remains the same,
    regardless of whether it is being used for staking or voting. In other
    words, the briber can only use $gvEASE for staking, but not for
    participating in DAO voting. This ensures that the integrity of the DAO
    voting process is maintained.

    The main uses of $gvEASE tokens

    * $gvEASE tokens are used for DAO voting.

    * $gvEASE tokens are used for staking in the vaults which will reduce the
    maximum fee.


    ### Bribes and Leasing

    Users who want to reduce the maximum fee for their desired vaults can offer
    $EASE tokens as a bribe to $gvEASE holders. Protocols or users interested in
    reducing their vaults' max fees can buy $EASE tokens and offer them to
    $gvEASE holders as a bribe. Bribed $gvEASE cannot be used for DAO votes.

    The users can lease their $gvEASE tokens to get weekly $EASE rewards. The
    leased $gvEASE can be used for staking, but it cannot be used for DAO
    voting. Mostly, the vaults with very low maximum fees will lease $gvEASE
    tokens.
