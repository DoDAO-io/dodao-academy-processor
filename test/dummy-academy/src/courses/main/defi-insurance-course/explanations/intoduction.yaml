    ## Background 

    Insurance is one of the most important things to have in order to feel
    secure financially. A good insurance policy can  give someone peace of mind
    and the freedom to not have to worry about losing everything they've worked
    for in the event  of an accident or other unforeseen circumstance. In
    developed nations, a good insurance framework protects people from  having
    to worry about their health, their life, and their material possessions like
    their car, house, or business in  the event of an unexpected event.


    Insurance companies have been around for many years, but not a lot has
    changed in how they operate. In fact, trust in  these companies has been
    decreasing every year. Insurance is a type of industry that requires a lot
    of money to get  started, which prevents startups from entering the space
    and thus preventing any real change or innovation in the  insurance
    industry.  


    ## Challenges with Traditional Insurance 

    There are a few key issues that need to be addressed within the insurance
    industry: 

    1) The relationship between insurance companies and their customers is
    adversarial - meaning that companies profit more when customers make fewer
    claims. 

    2) There is a lack of trust because insurance contracts are often complex
    and designed to protect the organization rather than the customer. 

    3) ~30-40% of capital goes towards operational expenses.  

    4) High capital requirements makes it difficult for startups to join the
    industry, which in turn stifles innovation. 

    5) Core insurance business models are decades old and have seen little
    innovation in recent years.

    6) The insurance industry is notoriously slow-moving and risk-averse, which
    has resulted in many sectors being left out and not enjoying the benefits of
    insurance.

    ## DeFi and Insurance 

    Blockchain and DeFi are not just about transferring tokens from one person
    to another - they offer a lot of new finance  primitives that have changed
    how finance companies operate. Some of the new innovations in DeFi that
    relate to the  insurance industry include ...


    ### 1. Raising Capital 

    Tokenization and mechanisms like bonding curves and staking have made it
    easier to raise capital. These new innovative  methods reward early
    investors who take risks and believe in the vision.


    For example, when using a bonding curve to raise funds, people who invest at
    an earlier stage can get more tokens than  those investing at later stages.


    ### 2. Aligning Interests 

    Token models create flexiblity and allows protocols/projects to use
    innovative methods to ensure that everyone's  interests are aligned with
    common goals. For example, some of the most prominent functions in an
    insurance company  are claims assessment, treasury management, and
    underwriting. By adding rewards and penalizing wrong behavior, it  will
    bring interests closer together to achieve common goals.


    Moreover, different types of distribution models for tokens usually have a
    preference for long-term token holders  who have confidence in the project
    as opposed to those who are only focused on short-term token prices.


    ### 3. New Coordination Models 

    Coordination models enabled by DeFi and DAO have opened up opportunities for
    new types of organizations, in which  members may not even know one
    another's identities, but can still work together effectively. 


    In traditional organizations, decisions are made by top management, and all
    employees work towards meeting those  goals. In DAOs, teams vote on
    proposals in a democratic way. This gives members a voice, as anyone can
    create and  submit proposals, and by voting the community develops a sense
    of collective ownership.


    We are still in the experimental stage when it comes to DAOs, but we are
    already seeing that they can be much more  efficient than traditional
    organizations in many ways.


    ### 4. Customer and Insurance Company on same side 

    In traditional insurance companies, the relationship between the company and
    its customers is usually one where they're  against each other. This is
    because in order for the organization to grow, they need more funds which
    often comes from  raising prices or finding new customers. However, in the
    DeFi space most operations are handled by code which means  that the cost of
    serving 10,000 customers is pretty much the same as serving 100,000
    customers. This provides an  incentive for DeFi projects to develop products
    that are relevant and achieve mass adoption.


    Most Decentralized Finance protocols share profits among participants, and
    allow anyone to participate. This allows  customers to also participate and
    become stakeholders in the success of the protocol. This helps to create a
    sense of  ownership and responsibility among those using the protocol, and
    it also encourages continued usage and engagement as  users will want to see
    the project they're a part of succeed.


    ### 5. Transparency 

    How confident would you be in your insurance provider if you knew their
    total funds, profit margins, exact formula for  calculating premiums, and
    day-to-day operations? This is how most DeFi protocols operate.


    By having data on the blockchain, anyone can query it and see how it has
    changed over time. This develops confidence and also enables people outside
    the organization to provide critical feedback and insights.  You can see all
    the major data points for the leading DeFi insurance provider - Nexus Mutual
    - [here](https://nexustracker.io/) 


    ### 6. Innovation 


    Traditional insurance companies are hamstrung by bureaucracy and are slow to
    address newer, unestablished sectors.  However, the composable nature of
    DeFi primitives enables rapid innovation and offers new business models that
    are  not available in traditional insurance companies.


    For example, the crypto industry currently holds around $800 billion, but
    only a tiny percentage of that is insured.  Now there are a few DeFi
    insurance companies that offer crypto insurance which includes smart
    contract exploits, loss  of funds etc. This provides a much needed service
    for the rapidly growing crypto industry.

    We will be discussing some of the new business models we see in DeFi
    insurance protocols below. We will also be 

    discussing each of the DeFi Insurance Protocols in detail separately.


    ### Mutual or Cooperatives

    Before insurance companies came into existence, communities would band
    together and pool resources in order to 

    protect individual members from risks they all faced. If an unfortunate
    event occurred, the senior members of the 

    community would decide whether or not to provide assistance. All funds
    raised were used to benefit the members of 

    the community.


    Starting a mutual or cooperative can be complicated and expensive, with
    legal fees often running into the tens of 

    thousands of dollars.There are also many other challenges that exist in
    cooperatives, such as taking common decisions, 

    voting, and rewarding active participants over inactive members. The recent
    DAO movement in cryptocurrency is trying 

    to address many of these solutions and offers software solutions for many of
    these problems.


    NexusMutual is the most prominent DeFi insurance protocol, and it takes a
    cooperative approach to business. To 

    participate or buy insurance cover, one must be a member of the mutual. With
    this business model, both the cover 

    providers and insurance cover buyers work towards the success of the
    protocol.


    This approach ensures that everyone has a vested interest in the success of
    the protocol, and that everyone is working 

    together to make it successful. This cooperative approach is what makes
    NexusMutual different from traditional 

    insurance providers.


    ### Provide Warranty(Assurance)

    Bigger companies have the advantage when it comes to offering warranties for
    their products and services. If a customer 

    is dissatisfied with a purchase, they can receive a refund or some other
    form of compensation. This makes it difficult 

    for smaller businesses to compete in the same market.


    Tokenization can help startups by providing interesting models that solve
    problems related to the product or service 

    warranties. For example, a startup could ask investors to stake some funds
    to help offset the risk of a warranty, and 

    in return the startup would reward them with a portion of the premiums. This
    is somewhat similar to how public 

    insurance companies work, where the profits go to shareholders. However,
    DeFi provides a lot more flexibility 

    to investors, allowing them to invest and then earn based on their knowledge
    and risk appetite.


    In one of the sections, we will discuss the Sherlock protocol in detail.
    This protocol offers companies warranties against 

    any funds loss that may occur as a result of security exploits in the code
    that has been audited.


    ### Reciprocal Insurance

    There are three primary ways to structure an insurance company: the stock
    model, the mutual model, and the reciprocal 

    model. The reciprocal model is the least well-known of the three, but it has
    been gaining popularity over the last 

    decade.


    Under this structure, the insurance company is owned by its policyholders
    and managed by a third party known as an 

    attorney-in-fact. The attorney-in-fact runs the company’s day-to-day
    operations, such as issuing policies and handling 

    claims. They also oversee the distribution of expenses based on the
    membership’s potential risks.


    DeFi primitives such as DAOs and capturing data on-chain provide the
    essential tools needed for coordination and 

    transparency. DeFi insurance provider [Ease](https://ease.org) follows
    Reciprocal Model to provide insurance to its 

    customers.
